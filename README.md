# P6: Feedreader (TDD using JavaScript)

By [Erich Renken](https://github.com/erichrenken)

## Description
This project was designed to demonstrate how using Jasmine for TDD was an effective method of web development

## Installation

Download the files

```Git
git clone https://github.com/erichrenken/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader
```

Then simply open the index.html file with your favorite browser. You'll see the test results at the bottom of the page.

## Configuration

This project uses Jasmine libraries for testing purposes. While the libraries are a little dated (2.1.2), they are still working effectively. The project also uses jQuery and Handlebars, but those libraries are unrelated to the testing that we're using this project for.
